Clean the Data
For cleaning the data we have used the Regex library, while cleaning we first remove the URL's, then we remove the usernames starting with '@', after that we remove special characters and string 'RT' followed by two white spaces that denotes a retweet. It is also important to change the case of all the given words to lower case as python is case sensitive and all the words in the positive, negative and stop word list are in lower case. At last store different words as different elements of a list.
